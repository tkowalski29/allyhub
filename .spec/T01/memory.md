## Zadanie: AllyHub - Native macOS Menu Bar Timer Application [Zakończone z Build Issues]
**Date:** 2025-09-12 16:45:00
**Status:** 90% Complete - Build Issues Require Fix

### 1. Summary
* **Problem:** Need a native macOS timer application with floating HUD interface integrated with menu bar, supporting 60-minute countdown with task management and position persistence
* **Solution:** Implemented Swift 5.9+ native macOS app with SwiftUI + AppKit hybrid architecture featuring menu bar integration, floating HUD panel with hover controls, task management, and comprehensive persistence system

### 2. Reasoning & Justification

#### Architectural Choices
**Framework Stack: SwiftUI + AppKit Hybrid vs Pure AppKit**
- **Chosen:** SwiftUI for UI components with AppKit for system integration (NSStatusBar, NSPanel, NSApplication)
- **Rationale:** SwiftUI provides modern declarative UI with animations and state management, while AppKit handles macOS-specific menu bar and floating window behavior that SwiftUI cannot achieve alone
- **Trade-offs:** Hybrid complexity vs superior UI development experience and native macOS integration capabilities

**Application Type: Menu Bar Agent vs Standard App**
- **Chosen:** Menu bar agent application (LSUIElement=YES in Info.plist)
- **Rationale:** Timer app should be unobtrusive background utility accessible from menu bar, not cluttering Dock
- **Implementation:** NSApplication.setActivationPolicy(.accessory) + LSUIElement configuration

**State Management: ObservableObject vs ViewModels vs Single State Store**
- **Chosen:** Separate ObservableObject models (TimerModel, TasksModel) with shared instances
- **Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns, direct SwiftUI integration, and independent persistence for timer vs task data
- **Alternatives Considered:** Single state store was rejected due to mixing unrelated state concerns

#### Component Architecture Decisions
**Window Management: NSPanel vs NSWindow vs SwiftUI Window**
- **Chosen:** Custom NSPanel subclass (FloatingPanel) with SwiftUI content
- **Rationale:** NSPanel provides proper floating behavior (stays above other windows), proper focus handling, and system-level window positioning. SwiftUI WindowGroup insufficient for floating HUD requirements
- **Key Features:** .floating window level, .nonactivatingPanel behavior, draggable without focus stealing

**Timer Implementation: Timer vs DispatchSourceTimer vs CADisplayLink**
- **Chosen:** Foundation Timer with @MainActor isolation and proper cleanup
- **Rationale:** Simple 1-second tick requirement, proper SwiftUI integration, and reliable cleanup. Higher precision timers unnecessary for UI countdown display
- **Safety:** TimerContainer wrapper for safe cleanup in deinit, prevents timer leaks

**Persistence Strategy: UserDefaults vs Core Data vs JSON Files**
- **Chosen:** UserDefaults for both timer state and task data
- **Rationale:** Lightweight data (timer state, task list), simple key-value persistence, automatic synchronization. Complex database overkill for application scope
- **Features:** Automatic timer continuation across app restarts, position persistence, task state preservation

#### UI/UX Design Decisions
**HUD Expansion: Fixed Height vs Dynamic vs Overlay**
- **Chosen:** Fixed +100px height animation with SwiftUI transitions
- **Implementation:** 96px compact → 196px expanded with asymmetric move+opacity transitions
- **Rationale:** Predictable animation behavior, consistent visual design, smooth expansion without jarring layout shifts

**Hover Interaction: Always Visible vs Hover Reveal vs Click-to-Show**
- **Chosen:** Hover-reveal controls with individual button hover states
- **Rationale:** Clean minimal interface when not interacting, discoverable controls on hover, prevents accidental clicks
- **Implementation:** SwiftUI .onHover with animated button states and scale effects

**Task Management: Complex Project Management vs Simple Task Switching**
- **Chosen:** Simple linear task progression with mock task data
- **Rationale:** Timer app should focus on timing, not project management. Simple task switching provides context without complexity
- **Data Structure:** Array of mock tasks with current index tracking

#### Testing Strategy Decisions
**Test Architecture: Unit Tests vs Integration vs UI Tests**
- **Chosen:** Comprehensive unit tests for models with @MainActor isolation
- **Rationale:** Core logic in TimerModel and TasksModel requires thorough testing. UI testing complex due to AppKit+SwiftUI hybrid
- **Coverage:** Timer logic, formatting, state transitions, edge cases, async timer behavior

**Concurrency Model: Swift 6 vs Legacy Patterns**
- **Chosen:** Swift 6 concurrency with @MainActor isolation for UI models
- **Rationale:** Modern Swift concurrency eliminates data races and provides clear execution context
- **Challenge:** Swift 6 strict concurrency caused test compilation issues requiring fixes

#### Knowledge Transfer & Lessons Learned

**macOS Development Insights:**
1. **Menu Bar Apps:** LSUIElement + NSApplication.setActivationPolicy(.accessory) for proper agent behavior
2. **Floating Windows:** NSPanel with .floating level and .nonactivatingPanel required for HUD behavior
3. **SwiftUI + AppKit:** Hybrid approach necessary for advanced system integration
4. **Timer Implementation:** Foundation Timer with explicit cleanup patterns prevents memory leaks
5. **State Persistence:** UserDefaults sufficient for lightweight timer/task state management

**Swift Concurrency Lessons:**
1. **@MainActor Models:** ObservableObject models should be @MainActor for SwiftUI integration
2. **Timer Cleanup:** Proper cleanup patterns essential with @MainActor isolated code
3. **Test Isolation:** Test classes need @MainActor annotations for model access
4. **Swift 6 Migration:** Strict concurrency requires careful async boundary management

**UI/UX Implementation:**
1. **Hover Interactions:** SwiftUI .onHover with animated state provides excellent macOS feel
2. **Panel Expansion:** Fixed height animations more predictable than dynamic sizing
3. **Color Coding:** Timer state indication through color (blue=running, orange=paused, red=completed)
4. **SF Symbols:** Consistent icon usage creates native macOS appearance

**Project Structure Best Practices:**
1. **Modular Components:** Clear separation (App/, StatusBar/, HUD/, Model/) aids maintenance
2. **Delegate Patterns:** Clean component communication without tight coupling
3. **Resource Organization:** Separate Resources/ folder for Info.plist and entitlements
4. **Test Coverage:** Unit tests for models, integration tests for coordinators

#### Recommended Fix Implementation Order
1. **Immediate:** Fix 4 compilation errors to achieve buildable state
2. **Short-term:** Apply Swift 6 concurrency fixes to test suite
3. **Verification:** Manual testing against 9 acceptance criteria
4. **Polish:** Performance optimization and edge case handling
5. **Distribution:** Code signing and notarization for release
